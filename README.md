## Hi,

My name is Bernard Kung, I'm a recent graduate from Northeastern University with an MS in Operations Research. Here are some of the projects I have on github:

[Optimizing Radiation](https://bernardkung.github.io/OptimizingRadiation/)

Optimization project for a 128-beam array for radiation therapy, with models that can solve for the best beam intensities in a variety of scenarios.


[Goodreads](https://bernardkung.github.io/goodreads/)

Exploratory analysis of my past personal reading preferences with regards to year read and genre; includes R script for scraping genre data off Goodreads' website by bookID.
