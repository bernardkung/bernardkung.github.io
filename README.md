## Hi, my name is Bernard Kung.
I'm a recent graduate from Northeastern University with an MS in Operations Research. Here are some of the projects I have on github:

#### [Optimizing Radiation](https://bernardkung.github.io/OptimizingRadiation/)

Optimization project for a 128-beam array for radiation therapy, with models that can solve for the best beam intensities in a variety of scenarios.

#### [Teacher Salary](https://bernardkung.github.io/TeacherSalary/)

A comment on a recent Youtube video pointed out that public educator salaries are readily available as public information in some states.  This analysis focuses on two states, Pennsylvania and Ohio, with a goal of exploring any patterns of pay disparity which may exist between administrators and teachers. 

#### [Election 2016](https://bernardkung.github.io/Election2016)
